# CNN-Project on CIFAR-10 DATASET
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was optimized to perform various image classification tasks, employing the Hyperband algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. The model architecture was constructed using Keras, incorporating convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout layers to create a deep network. Additionally, during the data processing phase, the image data was prepared to meet the model's requirements, and after the training process, the model's performance was evaluated using a test set. This approach aimed to enhance the overall performance of the model.
